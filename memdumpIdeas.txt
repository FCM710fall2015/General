Evan: I can give you dumps of Windows 7, 8.1, etc. 
	note, my dumps are superior to volatility's github, because they only use Windows XP

      I (and anyone) can give you Linux dumps, whatever you want.

      I can give you clean install Mac dumps. 

      we can go to:
	github.com/volatilityfoundation/profiles 

      and get additional profiles (and memory dumps) from there.

Main idea: 

	dropbox, gmail
	USB stick passed around in class

	a few user created memdumps (mostly from Evan?  Any other volunteers?)
	a few dumps pulled off volatility and github and elsewhere (email all of us where you get them?)
	


	* load profiles and dumps into a folder on THIS github
	  (include where you got them)

(windows group: we'll talk about a command list of volatility
		we'll infect a VM with some malware, + run some simple process tests
		we want to emphasize 3d view of process:
			we see this port is open, but what time is it? 
			should it be open at this time?  should this process listen on it?
